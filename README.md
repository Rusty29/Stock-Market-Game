# Stock-Market-Game
I have done some of the the front end stuff.  I am going to upload that this friday and hopefully we an just use the readme as a TO DO list.  I am pretty sure we will have to impliment some api to get the data from yahoo finance and then to a database.  Other than that we an use most of what django has to offer to create an application in a few weeks.

We use the model-view-controller setup:
Create Models: Which will be fields in our database, which will get altered by a controller to update the view
Models: Stock Prices Model, Stock Model, Buy/Sell Order, Portfolio (for individual users), Maybe a few others

Create Views: Error, Register user, Login for existing user, Logout (only need one), Help, Search (...), Show individual stock, Buy Stock, Sell Stock, Create list of users and show leaderboard

Templates: Help, Index, Leaderboard, Portfolio, Stock
 
On the front end I feel like we can handle it easy with django, the backend can cause problems.
